# RushB
A PHP based CSGO-Server management Interface for LAN Tournaments.

I've used xPaw's Source Server Query to make this work: https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Source-Query  
Check him out too!  
## Developing-Process
All my test-runs, as well as troubleshooting, take(s) / took place on either my Laptop (Acer Helios 300), or one of my Dell Poweredge R710's at home.  
Both systems use VMs, which are running on Debian 9, 64 bit. I'm also using Apache2 and PHP 7.3.  
## What it needs
In order to set-up the RushB interface, you need:  
- A Webserver (I tested on Apache2)  
- A valid PHP installation (I tested on 7.3)  
- A SQL Database  
- The RushB-SP Plugin installed on your CS:GO Server
