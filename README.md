# RushB
A PHP based CSGO-Server management Interface for LAN Tournaments.

I've used xPaw's Source Server Query to make this work: https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Source-Query  
Check him out too!  
## Developing-Process
All my test-runs, as well as troubleshooting, takes place on either my Laptop (Acer Helios 300), or my Dell Poweredge R710 at home.  
Both systems use VMs, which are running on Debian 9, 64 bit. I'm also using Apache2 and PHP 7.3.
